We need not forget that we are able to exist today because we stand on the shoulders of giants. Those who paved the way before us, and made it possible to further the search for knowledge and pursue the spread of wisdom. Unfettered by chains, boundaries, or limits. 

Yokubi was created as a revised and improved version of [Sakubi](https://sakubi.neocities.org/). 

*Knowledge isn't property*

We shall not gatekeep it, nor its natural evolution, and we shall acknowledge those that helped by paying it forward, to the next generation.

## Thanks to

- The people in the [EJLX discord server](https://discord.gg/Japanese)
- The [massif.la](https://massif.la/ja) project for its example sentences
- All those that enjoy arguing online about Japanese, the sparks of knowledge spread every time we butt heads
- The original creator of Sakubi, a good friend
