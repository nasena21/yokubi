title: "Lesson 08: い-adjectives"

Japanese has two main categories of adjectives. Don't worry, they are not as complicated as the ones for verbs. It’s actually quite straightforward. 

These two categories are い-adjectives (形容詞) and な-adjectives (形容動詞). 

い-adjectives act similar to verbs and can conjugate. な-adjectives on the other hand act like nouns (and they often can also be used as nouns). We'll cover な-adjectives later.

Here's an example of an い-adjective in practice.

> <b>赤い</b>火<br>
> Red fire


The reason why い-adjectives are similar to verbs is because they can conjugate. 

To say some noun is/has some quality using い-adjectives, you can just make an “A is B” type of sentence with the adjective directly like this:

> 火が赤い<br>
> The fire is red.


You **must not** add だ after it:

> *火が赤いだ


This is **very** wrong and not worth providing a translation.

However, attaching です is okay here, but it doesn’t have the role of a copula in this usage. It just adds politeness and doesn’t carry any meaning whatsoever. This is the first major way that だ and です are different. When it's not attached to a noun, です is just a politeness marker.

> 火が赤い<br>
> The fire is red<br>
> 火が赤い<b>です</b><br>
> The fire is red (polite)

Beyond です, There can also be some other constructions that put だ after an い-adjective, but they are specific set expressions. Don't be surprised if you see them, but don't worry about it now.

Like with verbs, you can also conjugate い-adjectives. You can replace い with かった or くない to attach a past or negative conjugation:

> 火が赤<b>かった</b><br>
> The fire <b>was</b> red.<br>
> 火が赤<b>くない</b><br>
> The fire is <b>not</b> red.<br>
> 火が赤<b>くなかった</b><br>
> The fire <b>was not</b> red.


The adjective いい is an exception and it becomes よい \-\> よかった / よくない.

Since the ない in verbs also behaves as an い-adjective, you can conjugate it like one and continue the chain of conjugations that makes it possible to build the long strings of verbs we mentioned earlier.

> 見<b>る</b><br>
> to see (ichidan plain form)<br>
> 見<b>ない</b><br>
> to not see (negative)<br>
> 見<b>なかった</b><br>
> did not see (negative, past)


Adjectives can be turned into abstract nouns by replacing the い with さ. There are more ways to do this, but さ is by far the most common.

> 大き<b>い</b><br>
> large/big (adj)<br>
> 大き<b>さ</b><br>
> size/largeness (noun)
