title: "Lesson 05: Possession and attributes with の"
type: docs
---


の is a particle. It's a possessive marker and an attributive marker. "Attributive" here means that something is an attribute of something else, like an attribute in a video game, like the "flame" in "flame sword". The relationship is always straightforward.

> 私<b>の</b>ネコ<br>
> My cat<br>
> 君<b>の</b>X<br>
> Your X.<br>
> ネコ<b>の</b>先<br>
> Ahead of the cat<br>
> 男<b>の</b>子<br>
> Boy (metaphorically, male child)


If you get lost, the easiest way to remember の is: It's like "of", but it applies backwards.

> 夜<b>の</b>人<br>
> Person of the night


Sometimes "of" gets confusing, and you have to remember the idea of "attribute".

> 夜<b>の</b>海<br>
> The night sea<br>
> 海<b>の</b>夜<br>
> Night on the sea (NOT "night of the sea")


の is literally the single most common word in all of japanese, so make sure you remember it well!

> 彼女<b>の</b>子供<b>の</b>名前だ。<br>
> It is her child's name.
