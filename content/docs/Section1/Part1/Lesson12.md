title: "Lesson 12: Soft requests with てください and the imperative form"

The て form can also be used to make a simple command or order. When we add ください after the て form, we are politely asking someone to do something (for us), effectively giving them an order. This usage is so common that the ください part can be completely omitted and still maintain an imperative sense to the statement. Dropping ください makes it more casual and can come across as more direct (potentially rude).

> 野菜を食べ<b>てください</b><br>
> Please eat your veggies<br>
> <br>
> 食べ<b>て</b>、少年<br>
> Eat, boy.<br>
> <br>
> 見<b>て</b>！<br>
> Look!


It can also be used with negative verbs in the form of ないでください to express a soft prohibition or negative request. 

> バカなことを言わない<b>でください</b><br>
> Don’t say stupid things, please<br>
> <br>
> 食べ<b>ないで</b><br>
> Please don't eat.


ください can also be used as standalone verb, rather than an auxiliary. In this case, it means “please give me”. You can use it to order stuff in shops.

> 肉まんを<b>ください</b><br>
> Please give me a nikuman

It is worth noting there are other ways to make orders and imperative commands in Japanese. The て(ください) form is rather weak and fairly soft order. It’s closer to a polite request rather than a straight up command. 

This brings us to the fourth common verb stem, the imperative form. This is a "true" imperative form, rather than the simple request made by using てください alone. Be aware that the imperative form often sounds rude. 

You make the imperative of ichidan verbs with ろ, and of godan verbs by replacing the u sound with the e sound.

> 見<b>ろ</b>！<br>
> Look!<br>
> <br>
> 殺<b>せ</b><br>
> Kill!<br>
> <br>
> 切<b>れ</b><br>
> Cut!<br>
> <br>
> 買<b>え</b><br>
> Buy!


There is also an alternative imperative for ichidan verbs, but you can ignore it for now. It sounds archaic and pompous. Just remember that it exists:

> 食べ<b>よ</b>！<br>
> Eat!
