Let’s look at ている and てある now. They make use of いる/ある as auxiliary verbs.

ている indicates an enduring action or state. For a lot of verbs, this means progressive or continuous (enduring action), but for others, it means the result of an action remains in a certain condition (enduring state).

> 食べ<b>ている</b>  
> I'm eating. (enduring action)

> 死ん<b>でいる</b>  
> He's dead. (enduring state)


The い in ている is commonly dropped in conversation, both in writing and in speech. This includes ます form to (as てます).

> 食べ<b>てる</b>  
> I'm eating.


ておる is a formal variant of ている. おる and いる have mostly the same meaning. ておる can be spoken as とる.

> 何を言っ<b>ておる</b>のだ。  
> What are you saying


てある is about something being in an enduring state resulting from someone’s action. てある always expresses a resulting state, **never** an action.

> 晩ご飯はもう作っ<b>てある</b>  
> Dinner has already been made

てある can turn the direct object and into a subject. This means that the verb's normal "logical object" gets marked by が or は (or unmarked), like dinner in the example above. However, because Japanese is linguistically weird, sometimes を can be used, too.

Finally, it expresses a state, not an action, so てある should not be considered "the passive" version of the verb. Japanese has a real passive that we'll cover soon.
