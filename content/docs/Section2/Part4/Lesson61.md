ころ is a noun that roughly means "approximate time". You run into Xのころに a lot. This can either be a conjunction "around the time of X", or a noun like "the general time when X" with the に particle attached. In some situations ころ can attach directly to nouns as the suffix ごろ.

> 子供<b>のころに</b>見たアニメを思い出す。  
> I remembered an anime I watched <b>when I was</b> a child.  

> そういえば、去年の<b>今ごろ</b>だったかな？  
> Oh right, it was <b>around this time</b> last year I guess?  

くらい takes a measure or amount (including time) and makes it approximate. It is completely interchangeable with ぐらい and it is entirely up to speaker's preference.  

> 午後1時<b>ぐらい</b>で大丈夫？  
> Is <b>around</b> 1pm okay?  

It can also be used to mean "to the point where" or "to the level where" and not an inch beyond that.  

> 毎日食べたい<b>くらい</b>美味しかったです  
> It was delicious <b>to the point</b> where I’d want to eat it every day.

When paired with the は particle it gives a nuance of "at least".  

> 名前<b>くらいは</b>聞いたことがあるだろう。  
> You must have <b>at least</b> heard of its name.  

まで essentially means "up to" or "until". The limit or boundary marked by まで is included in the set.

> 世界が終わる日<b>まで</b>。  
> <b>Until</b> the day the world ends.

まで is often paired with から as 〜から〜まで (from 〜 until 〜).  

> 小さなこと<b>から</b>、大きなこと<b>まで</b>。  
> <b>From</b> the small things <b>to</b> the big things.

までに changes the meaning of まで to mean “by” (as in “do something by next Friday”)

> 明後日<b>までに</b>は終わらせます。  
> I will finish it <b>by</b> the day after tomorrow.

ほど essentially means "as" in terms of a comparison. Deep down the core meaning of ほど is “to the extent of”.

> 私は彼ら<b>ほど</b>強くない。  
> I am not <b>as</b> strong <b>as</b> them.

In positive statements where ほど attaches to an "amount", it's an approximation.

> 中身はまだ半分<b>ほど</b>残っている。  
> <b>About</b> half of the contents were still left.

すぎる is a verb and means "to exceed" or "to surpass". As an auxiliary verb, it means "too much" or indicates an excess of activity. It attaches to the ます stem.

> 美味しいものを食べ<b>すぎた</b>。  
> I ate <b>too much</b> good stuff.
