**Congratulations**. You have reached the end of the main guide. I knew you would make it.

The main content may be finished, but there is still a lot to learn. Every single lesson in this guide has been nothing but a tiny drop in the sea of Japanese grammar and constructions that you will encounter as you continue to immerse and experience natural language in context.

These are simply foundations, and to tell you the truth, they aren't even **all** of the foundations. There will still be a lot of basic stuff that you will miss, that you will look up, and that you will learn via exposure. As long as you keep moving forward, you will learn it.

<div class="warning">
While the <b>main</b> guide is finished, not all content that was in <a href=https://sakubi.neocities.org/>sakubi</a> has yet been ported over. We are still missing a lot of extra/hidden/optional lessons and intermissions. We plan to keep adding more and more content as we go. If you want to help, you can also join <a href=https://discord.gg/KZj4dVFDzu>our discord community</a>. Any feedback is welcome.
