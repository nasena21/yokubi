# な-adjectives

Now let's look at な-adjectives, named after the な that comes after them. な adjectives are simple words that look like nouns, but they can be used attributively to describe other nouns by connecting them with the な “particle”. 

<pre>
バカ<b>な</b>子供
Stupid kid

大好き<b>な</b>人
Beloved person
</pre>

Now that we learned what relative clauses are, it’s good to learn that the term “attributively” basically means “as a relative clause”.

At the end of sentences, な-adjectives can look like nouns, and just like nouns they can end sentences with だ

<pre>
この部屋は静か<b>だ</b>
This room is quiet.
</pre>

<div class="warning">
Reminder: In normal colloquial Japanese, sentences that end with nouns or な adjectives do not need to end with だ, despite this being what is traditionally taught in school. この部屋は静か is already a complete, standalone, and valid sentence.
</div>

The な “suffix” is basically what allows な adjectives to work attributively in a sentence. You might have noticed this \<adj\>な\<noun\> structure looks very similar to \<noun\>の\<noun\> structure we’ve already seen in [Lesson 5](./Lesson5.md). な can even be used this way with some normal nouns, not just な-adjectives, but it is a bit of an exceptional usage with some specific nuance that we don’t need to worry about now. 

<pre>
魔法の世界
World of magic

魔法な世界
Magic-ish world
</pre>

魔法 is a noun (magic), and does not normally take な like this, but some authors might write something like this to give it a special vibe.

Going back to normal な-adjectives, they should be considered separate from nouns, and dictionaries do keep them as such. They clearly distinguish nouns (名詞) and な-adjective (形容動詞) as different categories. While a lot, if not most, of な-adjectives are also nouns, some of them aren’t, and cannot be used that way. For example, you cannot attach case marking particles directly to them.

<pre>
元気<b>な</b>人
An energetic person

元気<b>が</b>出る
To feel energized (lit. energy comes out)

静か<b>な</b>人
A quiet person

*静か<b>が</b>？？？
(ungrammatical sentence fragment)
</pre>

In the example above, 元気 works both as a な-adjective and as a noun, but 静か can only work as a な-adjective. 

Some resources also recognize so-called の-adjectives, which are just nouns that are a bit special because they can turn into having an adjective-like meaning using の instead of な. 

<pre>
英語の本
English-language books. (NOT "books of english")

普通<b>の</b>人
A normal person.
</pre>
