# い-adjectives

Japanese has two main categories of adjectives. Don't worry, they are not as complicated as the ones for verbs. It’s actually quite straightforward. 

These two categories are い-adjectives (形容詞) and な-adjectives (形容動詞). 

い-adjectives act similar to verbs and can conjugate. な-adjectives on the other hand act like nouns (and they often can also be used as nouns). We'll cover な-adjectives later.

Here's an example of an い-adjective in practice.

<pre>
<b>赤い</b>火
Red fire
</pre>

The reason why い-adjectives are similar to verbs is because they can conjugate. 

To say some noun is/has some quality using い-adjectives, you can just make an “A is B” type of sentence with the adjective directly like this:

<pre>
火が赤い
The fire is red.
</pre>

You **must not** add だ after it:

<pre>
*火が赤いだ
</pre>

This is **very** wrong and not worth providing a translation.

However, attaching です is okay here, but it doesn’t have the role of a copula in this usage. It just adds politeness and doesn’t carry any meaning whatsoever. This is the first major way that だ and です are different. When it's not attached to a noun, です is just a politeness marker.

<pre>
火が赤い
The fire is red

火が赤い<b>です</b>
The fire is red (polite)
</pre>

Beyond です, There can also be some other constructions that put だ after an い-adjective, but they are specific set expressions. Don't be surprised if you see them, but don't worry about it now.

Like with verbs, you can also conjugate い-adjectives. You can replace い with かった or くない to attach a past or negative conjugation:

<pre>
火が赤<b>かった</b>
The fire <b>was</b> red.

火が赤<b>くない</b>
The fire is <b>not</b> red.

火が赤<b>くなかった</b>
The fire <b>was not</b> red.
</pre>

The adjective いい is an exception and it becomes よい \-\> よかった / よくない.

Since the ない in verbs also behaves as an い-adjective, you can conjugate it like one and continue the chain of conjugations that makes it possible to build the long strings of verbs we mentioned earlier.

<pre>
見<b>る</b>
to see (ichidan plain form)

見<b>ない</b>
to not see (negative)

見<b>なかった</b>
did not see (negative, past)
</pre>

Adjectives can be turned into abstract nouns by replacing the い with さ. There are more ways to do this, but さ is by far the most common.

<pre>
大き<b>い</b>
large/big (adj)

大き<b>さ</b>
size/largeness (noun)
</pre>
