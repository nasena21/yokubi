# More negatives with なくて, ないで, ず and ずに

We briefly discussed the difference between なくて and ないで in [Lesson 11](../../Section1/Part1/Lesson11.md). Let's dig a bit deeper into it.

When we make a verb or い adjective into the なくて form, this behaves like a usual て conjunctive form (“do X, and…”). It is common in this usage to imply some cause \-\> effect sequence (“I didn’t do X, and that is why Y happened”) although not strictly required. 

<pre>
お役に立て<b>なくて</b>すみません。  
I am sorry I <b>was not</b> helpful (lit. “I was not helpful <b>and so</b> I am sorry”)
</pre>

We can also make the negative with ないで instead, however in contrast with なくて, this usage often implies a manner or state in which the following action is being done. You can think of the statement before ないで to become an “adverb” to the statement after it.

<pre>
もしかして、食べ<b>ないで</b>待っていたのか
Perhaps… did you wait <b>without eating</b>?

ノックもし<b>ないで</b>部屋に入る。
To enter the room <b>without even knocking</b>.
</pre>

There is another way we can use なくて and ないで, and that is using the verb forms 〜ず and 〜ずに. ず is an archaic conjugation of the negative auxiliary verb ぬ, but you don’t really need to know this. Just remember that 〜ず is almost a 1:1 replacement to なくて (or in some cases なく), and 〜ずに is a replacement of ないで. In **some** cases, 〜ず alone (without に) can also be used as ないで (Yay, Japanese!).

<pre>
お役に立て<b>ず</b>、申し訳ございません。
I am sorry I <b>was not</b> helpful

何も食べ<b>ずに</b>眠ってしまった。
He fell asleep <b>without</b> eating anything
</pre>

ず and ずに are more formal and stiff-sounding than their なくて and ないで counterparts and are mostly used in literary stuff. However you will still hear plenty of ずに in spoken language too and they show up a lot in common phrases and expressions.
