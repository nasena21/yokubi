# The causative form

せる is a "causative" helper verb form. It means the action of making or letting someone do something. Yes, it's used for both **forcing** people and **allowing** people.

For godan verbs, せる attaches to the negative stem. For ichidan verbs, さ is inserted between せる and the stem:

<pre>
終わら<b>せる</b>
To make (something) end

死な<b>せる</b>
To let (someone) die

食べ<b>させる</b>
To make (someone) eat
</pre>

<div class="warning">
Reality check: there are exceptions and short/colloquial forms (書かせる -> 書かす). You don’t need to worry about them too much but be aware they exist. 
</div>

When we use a verb in causative form, the causer/agent (= the one that does the “forcing” or “allowing”) is usually marked by は or が. The causee/target (= the one that is “forced” or “allowed”) can be either marked with に or を. The choice between these two particles depends on the verb being used.

When we use に, the interpretation of the causative is that of “allow” rather than “force”. On the other hand, when we use を, it could be either of them. 

With intransitive verbs, the target can be marked by を, but with transitive ones the target can only be marked by に. In this type of usage, with transitive verbs, it is sometimes hard to tell if the sentence means “to allow” or “to force”.

<pre>
子供<b>を</b>外で遊<b>ばせる</b>。
To let the kids play outside.

子供<b>に</b>飲<b>ませる</b>酒はない。
I won't make/let a child drink alcohol.
</pre>

The causative form can also be chained with the passive (せる \-\> せられる).

<pre>
書く to write
書かせる to make (someone) write
書かせられる to be made to write (by someone)
</pre>

Causative-passive sentences cannot assume the meaning of “to be allowed” but only “to be forced”. 

When used with する verbs, the causative form can turn an intransitive する verb, into a transitive one (する -> させる).

<pre>
シミュレーターが起動<b>する</b>。
The simulator starts up. (intransitive)

カメラアプリを起動<b>させる</b>。
I start up the camera app. (transitive)
</pre>
