# Permission with いい and negative invitations with ませんか

いい just means "good" or "fine" and isn't a grammatical term in itself, but it's used often in patterns about permission. After て form it’s asking for permission to do the action marked by て. てもいい also works mostly the same and you’ll see either quite often.

<pre>
食べて(も)<b>いい</b>？
Can I eat?
<b>いい</b>よ
Sure
</pre>

When people use よかった they're normally expressing gladness, not goodness. よかった shouldn't be used for permission.

<pre>
来てくれて<b>よかった</b>
I am glad you came.
</pre>

When negation is involved, "permission" statements with いい often walk the line between permission and request, just like excessively polite English. When it comes to negative + ていい, both ないで(も)いい and なくて(も)いい mean roughly the same thing and are mostly interchangeable. なくて(も)いい is more common.

<pre>
食べなくて(も)<b>いい</b>よ
It’s okay if you don’t eat
</pre>

As a response, いい(です) usually assumes the meaning of rejection (like “I’m good” in English).

<pre>
レジ袋ご利用ですか?
Do you need a bag?
いや、<b>いいです</b>
Nah, I’m good.
</pre>

In a previous lesson we saw the volitional form can be used to invite/urge someone to do something with you. There is another way to ask someone if they want to do something together with you, and that is to use a question phrased in the negative. This is similar to the English “won’t you… ?”.

<pre>
明日、映画を見に<b>行かない</b>？
Why don’t we go see a movie tomorrow?
</pre>

This structure can also be used for requests that aren’t invitations.

<pre>
すいません、もう一回言ってくれ<b>ませんか</b>？
I’m sorry, could you repeat that again? (lit. “won’t you say it again?”)
</pre>
