# Likeness and hearsay with みたい, らしい, ぽい, and そう

There are many ways in Japanese to say "X resembles Y" or "X looks like Y".

One of them, is the な adjective suffix みたい. It looks like the たい form of 見る \-\> 見たい, however in modern Japanese this is considered a completely separate thing and should not be confused.

みたい (it is **always** written in kana and should **never** be written as 見たい) is a な-adjective and conjugates like one. It means “seems”. 

<pre>
あの人、日本人<b>みたい</b>
That person, it seems like he’s Japanese / He seems Japanese

ヒーロー<b>みたいな</b>人
Person that resembles a hero
</pre>

While みたい is for all intents and purposes a な adjective, when used adverbially it sometimes conjugates like an い adjective. This is seen as casual/slang, but you’ll see it often enough in Japanese media that it is good to be aware of it.

<pre>
子供<b>みたいに</b>ブランコに乗っている
子供<b>みたく</b>ブランコに乗っている
He was on the swing like a child
</pre>

Both of these examples are valid, but the former is more proper.

らしい is an auxiliary adjective that attaches to nouns or verbs/adjectives and says that something factually "seems so" based on circumstance. らしい is appropriate for things that would translate to "seems X", rather than "Xish".

<pre>
日本人<b>らしい</b>名前。
A name that seems Japanese.
</pre>

You might also see らしい used to mean “I heard that”, used to convey hearsay or information obtained from third parties.

<pre>
出発は明日の昼頃になる<b>らしい</b>。
<b>I heard that</b> the departure will be tomorrow at around noon.
</pre>

ぽい/っぽい is a suffix い adjective that says that something subjectively "seems so" based on appearance or stereotypical properties. It translates well as "Xish" or "X-like". It sounds casual.

<pre>
今、僕の名前、女<b>っぽい</b>って思ったでしょ？
You just thought my name sounded feminine<b>-ish</b>, right? (lit: “female-ish” or “woman-ish”)
</pre>

There are two separate constructions of the auxiliary suffix そう.

The first one attaches to the masu stem of a verb or adjective, and it means “seems like”. It is used to describe things from a subjective impression or perspective, often from physical appearances. そう turns whatever it attaches to into a な adjective.

<pre>
おいし<b>そう</b>なスープです。
A delicious-looking soup.
</pre>

<div class="warning">
Do not confuse the word かわいそう (pitiful) with the そう version of かわいい (cute). There is no そう version of かわいい. If you want to say something seems cute, you can use かわいくみえる instead.
</div>

The other そう attaches to the complete form of the word before it, so for な adjectives and nouns it becomes だそう. This usage means “I heard that” and it is similar to the hearsay usage of らしい we saw earlier. It feels a bit more formal.

<pre>
2000人以上が死んだ<b>そう</b>です。
I <b>heard that</b> over 2000 people died.
</pre>
