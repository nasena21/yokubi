# か, も, and でも as question word modifiers

Besides marking questions, か can also be used to turn question words into generic nouns. 

|            |               |
|------------|---------------|
| なに       | what          |
| なに**か** | **some**thing |

<br />
 
|            |             |
|------------|-------------|
| だれ       | who         |
| だれ**か** | **some**one |

<br />

|            |               |
|------------|---------------|
| どこ       | where         |
| どこ**か** | **some**where |

<br />

|            |                           |
|------------|---------------------------|
| いつ       | when                      |
| いつ**か** | **some**time ("somewhen") |

Often なにか is slurred as なんか:

<pre>
<b>なんか</b>飲む？
Do you want <b>something</b> to drink?
</pre>

Make sure to not confuse the following two usages:

<pre>
何<b>が</b>あった？  
What happened? (lit. What was there?)

何<b>か</b>あった？  
Did something happen? (lit. Was something there?)
</pre>

Note how with question words + か it is common to drop the が particle after them (何かが -> 何か), possibly because it is easier to pronounce. 

In a similar manner, we can also use も to turn question words into "inclusive/exclusive" nouns. Think about words like “anything” or “nothing” in English. 

|        |                          |
|--------|--------------------------|
| なにも | anything/nothing         |
| だれも | everyone/anyone/no one   |
| どれも | any of them/none of them |
| いつも | anytime/never/always     |

<pre>
ここは何<b>も</b>ない  
There is <b>no</b>thing here

誰<b>も</b>知ってること  
Things that <b>every</b>one/<b>any</b>one knows.

いつ<b>も</b>そんなことを考えてるの？  
Have you <b>always</b> been thinking about that?
</pre>

There's a logical distinction between "every particular thing" and "any one particular thing". By attaching でも to some of these words, you can give them the "any" sense of "any one particular thing".

<pre>
あんたは誰<b>でも</b>助けるの？  
Would you (really) save <b>anyone</b> (no matter who)?

場所はどこ<b>でも</b>いい。  
<b>Anywhere</b> (no matter where) is fine
</pre>
