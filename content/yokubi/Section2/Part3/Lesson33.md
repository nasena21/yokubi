# Question words: なに, だれ, どれ, いつ, etc

These are called interrogatives. They're used in order to ask wh-questions. They sometimes show up also as parts of larger grammatical constructs or set expressions.

| Kanji| Reading     | Meaning | Example (JP)             | Example (EN)                    |
|------|-------------|---------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 何   | なに        | what    | 何する？                 | What will you do?               |
| 誰   | だれ        | who     | あなた、誰？             | Who are you?                    |
|      | どれ        | which   | どれがいいと思いますか？ | Which one do you think is good? |
|      | いつ        | when    | 次の電車はいつですか？   | When is the next train?         |

There are many other question words, they all work similarly so we won’t be listing all of them. If you recall the lesson on こそあど words, the ど part of the こそあど set refers to these words.

When asking questions, one thing to keep in mind is to **never** mark these words with the particle は. The only exception is some set expressions like 何はともあれ but you can literally count these on one hand.
